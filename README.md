# Hospital Resource Allocation System - README

## 🚀 About The Project

A CLI-based Java project that efficiently manages hospital department resource allocation using graph algorithms (Prim's and Kruskal's) to optimize inter-department connectivity and resource utilization.

## 🎯 Objective

To model a real-world system for managing hospital resources effectively while applying graph algorithms and object-oriented principles.

## ✨ Features

* Add departments with beds and equipment.
* Add and manage connection edges with costs.
* Compute Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's (and optionally Kruskal's) algorithms.
* Calculate cost-efficient paths between departments.
* Allocate and track resources across departments.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Java 17
* Collections API (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `PriorityQueue`)
* Graph Algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's)
* CLI-based interaction

## 📂 File Structure (Simplified)

* `Department.java`: Department entity structure.
* `Edge.java`: Edge structure between departments.
* `HospitalResourceAllocator.java`: Main CLI and algorithm handler.
* `test/`: JUnit test cases for validation.
